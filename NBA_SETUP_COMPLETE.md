# NBA Integration Complete! üèÄ

## What Was Done

### 1. Updated Excel Converter (`excel_to_js.py`)
- Now processes **both** `NFL_master_list.xlsx` and `NBA_master_list.xlsx`
- Creates three separate JavaScript arrays:
  - `NFL_PLAYERS` - 264 NFL players
  - `NBA_PLAYERS` - 234 NBA players
  - `WELL_KNOWN_PLAYERS` - Combined 498 players
- Handles different column names in each Excel file:
  - NFL: Name, Most Recent Team, College, Jersey Number, Position
  - NBA: Name, Team Most Associated, Jersey #, College/Origin

### 2. Updated Data Loader (`utils/dataLoader.js`)
- New `loadPlayers(sport)` function that accepts:
  - `'nfl'` or `'NFL'` - Returns only NFL players
  - `'nba'` or `'NBA'` - Returns only NBA players
  - `'both'` (default) - Returns all players combined
- Sport-specific question wording:
  - NFL: "Which college did [player] attend?"
  - NBA: "Where did [player] play college basketball?"
  - Jersey questions adapt verb tense appropriately
- Smart caching by sport to improve performance

### 3. Updated Game Logic (`script.js`)
- Questions now use the selected sport from `currentGame.sport`
- Added college name variations for popular basketball schools:
  - Duke, Kentucky (UK), North Carolina (UNC)
  - UCLA, Kansas (KU), Syracuse (Cuse)
  - UConn, and more...
- Flexible matching works across both NFL and NBA

### 4. Player Data Generated
- **NFL**: 264 well-known players (Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, etc.)
- **NBA**: 234 well-known players (LeBron James, Stephen Curry, etc.)
- All data stored in `well_known_players.js`

## How It Works

### Sport Selection
When a player selects their sport (NFL, NBA, or Both):
1. The game loads only the relevant player pool
2. Questions are generated from that pool
3. Distractors (wrong answers) come from the same sport
4. College name matching uses appropriate variations

### Separation by Sport
- **NFL Only**: Questions only use NFL players
- **NBA Only**: Questions only use NBA players  
- **Both**: Questions randomly mix NFL and NBA players

### Example Flow
```
User selects: NBA + College Guesser
‚Üì
Game loads: 234 NBA players
‚Üì
Generates question: "Where did LeBron James play college basketball?"
Options: St. Vincent-St. Mary HS (OH), Davidson, Texas, Duke
‚Üì
User types: "St Vincent St Mary" ‚Üí ‚úÖ Correct!
```
